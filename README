LDAP Proxy Servers

---------
BindProxy
---------

Records failed BIND attempts.  If the same invalid credentials are presented,
a failure response is returned, and the proxied LDAP service is *not* consulted.

The use case is to prevent account lockouts due to the *same* bad credentials
being repeatedly presented (e.g. by a misconfigured mail client).

Usage

To run in the foreground::
