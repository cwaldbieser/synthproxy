--------------------------
StartTLS and BIND Requests
--------------------------
* For specific puposes, the proxy could be allowed to accept anonymous BINDs.
  The back-end could be queried with dedicated credentials.
* Are BIND requests being cached?  Could they be?

-----------------
Attribute Caching
-----------------
* Attributes don't have to be evicted from the cache after a certain amount
  of time.  CouchDB supports change notifications.

---------------------
LDAP Response Caching
---------------------
* These are also evicted from the cache after a small time elapses.
  The eviction time could be increased, if data can be somewhat stale.
  If the primary data of interest is coming from CouchDB, this could
  be increased to a very large number, or even be triggered by an
  eviction service.  E.g. each day a process runs to see if any subjects
  were dropped and should be evicted from the cache.  It notifies the
  proxy (via TCP, flat file, whatever) which then processes the evictions.
* If there is only one primary service DN that is allowed to use the proxy,
  the caching mechanism can be modified to not account for the BIND
  information.  This would also hold true if all DNs that can query the 
  proxy are required to have the same level of access.
